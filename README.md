### What I learned

This is a great way top understand css behavior, and also to improve some html basic skills.

This was the frist time i'm using a gradiant background in CSS

```css
body {
  background: radial-gradient(
    circle at center,
    hsl(220, 15%, 75%),
    hsl(220, 15%, 45%)
  );
}
```

### Continued development

In the future i could improve the code to make a smoother responsive desgin.
